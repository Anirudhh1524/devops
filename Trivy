Trivy is an open-source, all-in-one security scanner used to detect vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, secrets, 
and compliance issues across containers, Kubernetes, code repositories, and cloud environments.
________________________________________
What Trivy Does
•	Vulnerability Scanning (CVE detection): Finds known vulnerabilities in operating system packages and application dependencies.
•	Misconfiguration Detection: Checks Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files (Terraform, Kubernetes YAML, Dockerfiles) for insecure configurations.
•	Secrets Scanning: Identifies hardcoded secrets such as API keys or passwords in codebases.
•	SBOM (Software Bill of Materials): Generates SBOMs to help track dependencies and ensure supply chain security.
•	Multi-Environment Coverage: Works across container images, file systems, Git repositories, and cloud infrastructure.
________________________________________
Key Features
•	Ease of Use: A single binary installation, no external database dependencies required.
•	Speed: Designed for fast scans, making it suitable for CI/CD pipelines.
•	Integration: Works seamlessly with DevOps workflows, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, and Kubernetes admission controllers.
•	Open Source: Backed by Aqua Security, widely adopted in the cloud-native community.
•	Extensibility: Supports plugins and integrations with other security tools.

Typical Use Cases
•	Developers: Quickly check local code or container images before pushing to production.
•	DevOps Teams: Automate scans in CI/CD pipelines to enforce security gates.
•	Security Teams: Continuous monitoring of Kubernetes clusters and cloud environments.
•	Compliance: Generate SBOMs for regulatory requirements like supply chain transparency.
