Git hub Merge Repository :
1.	Clone repository using url Commend “git clone” https://github.com/Anirudhh1524/meeting-app.git
2.	Open folder
cd meeting app
3.	Then check branch which you are present
4.	If it is main branch switch to master
5.	Open present file file in master.
6.	Check all present files
7.	Then fire command “git merge master”
8.	If you have error “Already up to date” fire Command 
git merge master --allow-unrelated-histories && Ctrl+Z
Then --
git checkout -b main origin/main
Then --
git branch -m master main
git push origin -u main
git push origin --delete master

git merge master
git merge master --allow-unrelated-histories
git checkout -b main origin/main
git branch -m master main
git push origin -u main
git push origin --delete master

rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with study materials"


fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
🤔 Why this happens
Git is saying:
“These two branches don’t share a common commit history.”
This usually happens when:
•	main was created separately (e.g., via GitHub with a README)
•	dev was created locally with its own commits
•	Two repos were initialized independently and then connected

Fix (Most common & safe)
Allow Git to merge unrelated histories once:
git checkout main
git merge master --allow-unrelated-histories
If there are conflicts:
# resolve conflicts
git add .
git commit
Then push:
git push origin main

If master is a remote branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge origin/master --allow-unrelated-histories
git push origin main

Clean Alternative (Recommended if repo is new)
If this is a new project and you don’t care about history:

Option 1: Make master the base ( IMP COMMAND DIRECTLY WORK )
git checkout master
git branch -M main
git push -f origin main

This rewrites history — use only if you’re sure.

When NOT to use --allow-unrelated-histories
•	Large team
•	Production repos
•	When histories should be related (then something is wrong)

Verify after merge
git log --oneline --graph --all

Best Practice (future-proof)
Always create branches from main:
git checkout main
git checkout -b master

Suppose Main Repo Deleted And you Want To add your code in new repo.
Recommended Fix (safe & correct)
1️⃣ Pull remote changes first (rebase is best)
git pull origin main --rebase

2️⃣ Push again
git push origin main
