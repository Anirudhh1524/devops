Blue-Green and Canary deployments are **strategies used in software release management** to reduce downtime and risk when deploying new versions of applications. 

 üîµüü¢ Blue-Green Deployment

Concept:
Maintain two identical environments ‚Äî **Blue** (current production) 
                                      **Green** (new version).

- **How it works:**
  - Blue is live and serving users.
  - Green is updated with the new version and tested.
  - Once verified, traffic is switched from Blue to Green.
  - If issues arise, rollback is easy by switching back to Blue.

- **Benefits:**
  - Zero downtime
  - Easy rollback
  - Safe testing in production-like environment

- **Use case:** 
Ideal for major updates where you want full control over switching environments.



üê§ Canary Deployment

**Concept:** Gradually roll out the new version to a small subset of users before full deployment.

- **How it works:**
  - A small percentage of users (the "canaries") get the new version.
  - Monitor performance, errors, and user feedback.
  - If stable, increase rollout to more users until full deployment.
  - If problems occur, rollback affects only a small group.

- **Benefits:**
  - Early detection of issues
  - Controlled risk
  - Real-world testing with real users

- **Use case:**
Perfect for frequent updates or when you want to test new features incrementally.

### üß† Quick Comparison

| Feature             | Blue-Green Deployment | Canary Deployment       |
|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Rollout Style       | All-at-once switch     | Gradual rollout          |
| Risk Level          | Low (easy rollback)    | Very low (small exposure)|
| Infrastructure Need | Two full environments  | One environment with routing logic |
| Monitoring          | Before switch          | During rollout           |
